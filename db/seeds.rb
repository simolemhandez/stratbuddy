‚Ä¢ Post-patent expiry client‚Äôs share will shrink to 20% of share pre-patent expiry<br>

  - Who is paying for the product? insurance plan? the patient? healthcare security? <br>
  - What are the pros and the cons of our product vs. the substitute ? <br><br>

‚Ä¢ One comparable substitute currently exists that will divide market share equally
with client once client‚Äôs drug is in market<br>
‚Ä¢ Assume that the price of the product is comparable to the substitute at
$2,000/treatment, and that one treatment is needed per year<br>
‚Ä¢ Assume that our drug and current comparable substitute have no comparative
advantage over the other (both will charge the same price and split the market)<br>

First, the percentage of users paying monthly fees dropped quickly in 2013. This can be due to several reasons:
‚Ä¢ Increased competition in online dating market
‚Ä¢ Quality free dating apps released that are more convenient
‚Ä¢ Tinder app launched in late 2012 <br>

This also leads me to reconsider my recommendation:
‚Ä¢ I switch recommendation from monthly fee to premium account

  ‚Ä¢ Companies that have dedicated channel strategies tend to focus primarily on Direct Selling. Often this is a result of the desire for maximum consumer interaction and control over customer journey
‚Ä¢ Competitors who have a dedicated channel strategy use a primary channel to convey their products to consumers. For example: The Body Shop‚Äôs main customer-facing channel is their network of over 2,000 stores worldwide (this data is not given), however they also have a web channel in North America and a direct selling force
‚Ä¢ There a today a wide variety of distribution channels. For example, I imagine a brand as Estee Lauder sells their products in prestigious retail store, company-run salons and brand websites
‚Ä¢ There is a trend for companies to diversify, both in terms of product categories and channel strategies. This diversification is the result of different products requiring distinct channels and placements, and evolving clients habits (incl. multi-channels) <br>

<strong>Our client: </strong>
‚Ä¢ Our client has the higher number of product categories, yet with one of the less diverse channel strategies.
‚Ä¢ This can potentially explain our issue in term of profitability, as having one unique dedicated channel strategy for various product may not adapted to all product categories.

  correction: 'Initial analysis should show commodities and options to be most attractive in terms of market size, with commodities as the most attractive due to the lack of major players to inhibit entry. Both Options and Fixed Income seem to be markets where a few players dominate, making potential entry very difficult. Equities is interesting because of potential for cheap entry due to the liquidation of a major player‚Äôs assets, so further analysis is necessary

  For each market, to assess the attractiveness of the investment, I propose to calculate EBITDA and NPV.
  For instance, for equities:
  ‚Ä¢ EBITDA = Operating profit + Depreciation = 90 M‚Ç¨
  ‚Ä¢ NPV = ????? = 300 M‚Ç¨ <br>

  With the same approach, we obtain for commodities :
  ‚Ä¢ EBITDA = 100 M‚Ç¨
  ‚Ä¢ NPV = 0 <br>

  For options:
  ‚Ä¢ EBITDA = 100 M‚Ç¨
  ‚Ä¢ NPV = -500 M‚Ç¨ <br>

  For fixed income:
  ‚Ä¢ EBITDA = 100 M‚Ç¨
  ‚Ä¢ NPV = -100 M‚Ç¨ <br>

  Based on NPV analysis, equities are the investment to make due to the cheap entry cost. This carries an added benefit of leaving $1 billion free for other uses. Candidate can include this excess sum in calculation, but that isn‚Äôt necessary. <br>

  Despite its artistic reputation, the orchestra has experienced a number of financial difficulties during its 80-year history. The recent past has proven no different, as the MSO has seen a steady drop in revenues over the last 3 years. This revenue decline has led to budget deficits that the orchestra has had to finance through borrowing.<br><br>

  Like many non-profit organizations, the MSO‚Äôs revenues can be split into three main sources. The first is earned income, which primarily takes the form of ticket revenue from both single ticket sales and discounted multi-concert subscriptions. The second is annual donations by individuals, companies, government bodies, and charitable foundations. The final source is the symphony‚Äôs endowment, a pool of professionally managed donated funds of which the MSO receives a small fixed percentage or ‚Äúdraw‚Äù each year. <br><br>

  Six months ago, the MSO board welcomed a new President, Kevin Stevens, to lead the organization. Mr. Stevens has called on McKinsey to help his management team address the declining revenue problem.

- Overall earned income is down because of a decline in subscription sales, with full-season subscription sales being particularly hard hit<br>
- Total subscription revenues are down, but not because subscriber renewal rates are falling<br>
- Individual ticket sales are up, which partially‚Äîbut not fully‚Äî offsets the decline in subscription revenues<br>
***<br>
<strong>Possible explanations for the results</strong> (Remember that pricing and marketing strategy have not changed during the past 3 years):<br>
- Current subscribers are switching to cheaper seats. People who purchased expensive seats the year prior are renewing, but choosing to buy cheaper seats this year<br>
- Subscribers may be migrating to shorter commitment options. The sharp decline in full-season subscriptions, relatively small decline in half-season subscriptions, and the increase in single ticket revenue suggest that customers are shifting away from up-front, higher-commitment purchases.<br>

<strong>A very good answer might also include:</strong>
- The number of new subscribers is declining. While the MSO has managed to maintain a steady rate of subscription renewals, the number of new subscribers is shrinking:<br>
> New subscribers tend to have lower renewal rates than long-time subscribers, so fewer new subscribers may explain why the MSO‚Äôs overall renewal rates have not suffered<br>

  timing: 10,
  correction: '<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> Potential recommendations:</strong></span> <br>
<strong> Improve subscriber renewal rates (especially first-year subscribers)</strong> <br>
‚Ä¢ MSO should focus improving subscriber retention rates and usher new subscribers into their 3rd year (when they become ‚Äúlocked-in‚Äù and extremely loyal). Focused market research efforts to understand why new subscribers are not renewing should be undertaken, and appropriate adjustments (product, advertising, channel, pricing) should be made
Explore ways to cost effectively increase the number of new subscribers<br>
‚Ä¢ Given that the MSO‚Äôs audience is aging, finding ways to appeal new‚Äîand perhaps younger‚Äîmarket segments is a bold but potentially winning strategy. However, new customers carry high acquisition costs, so this might be a second- priority initiative (e.g., one that is pursued after renewal rates improve).<br>
<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Challenges:</span>
<br> <strong>Cannibalization</strong>
<br>‚Ä¢ Ticket sales. Encouraging sales of single ticket and shorter (i.e., lower-
priced) subscription packages may further exacerbate the decline in full- season subscription revenue and hurt‚Äîrather than help‚Äîthe top line. (It is essential to determine whether the people in the market for shorter- commitment tickets are the largely the same as those who would buy longer subscriptions. If they are, then MSO needs to be more concerned with cannibalization)
<br>‚Ä¢ Donations. MSO would likely be approaching the same set of donors for both the endowment campaign and its annual giving campaigns. Since many donors would substitute annual giving for endowment giving, MSO needs to account for the likely decline in its near-term giving revenue.
<br>***
<br>A very good answer might include the following:
<br><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> Potential recommendations:</strong></span>
<br>Take changing consumer preferences and market trends into account
<br>‚Ä¢ The gradual shift in consumer preferences towards single ticket sales may signal
opportunity to further boost this revenue source. Determining who these single ticket buyers are and how are how to better serve/market to them could be key
Consider launching an endowment campaign to increase the endowment base ‚Ä¢ The MSO‚Äôs annual giving is strong and suggests a campaign to garner
endowment contributions could succeed. This would also help diversify the MSO‚Äôs overall revenue portfolio, which currently relies heavily on earned income and annual giving
<br><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong> Challenges:</strong></span>
<br><strong>MSO‚Äôs lack of sales and marketing acumen, skills</strong>
<br>‚Ä¢ MSO sales and marketing track record (e.g., strategy, pricing, and product have remained stagnant even though revenues have continually fallen) suggests a lack of strength in these areas
Timing of costs and benefits associated with endowment campaign
<br>‚Ä¢ Launching an endowment campaign requires front-loaded, short-term costs
(e.g., planning time, development of promotional materials, donor identification and strategy), whereas endowment campaign benefits tend to be long-term in nature
<br>‚Ä¢ MSO needs to assess whether it can financially afford to wait before realizing the long-term benefits of a campaign
<br><strong>Value proposition to endowment campaign donors</strong>
<br>‚Ä¢ Because of its checkered financial record and history of financial
irresponsibility, some potential donors (particularly foundations) may be skeptical of giving the MSO additional money during an endowment campaign. These donors might want to see credible proof of fiscal responsibility and greater self-sufficiency prior to giving
<br> <strong> Diversion of organization‚Äôs attention and focus</strong>
<br>‚Ä¢ Given the resource-consuming nature of an endowment campaign and/or
new marketing efforts, management could become distracted and fail to focus on the day-to-day operations of the symphony.',
